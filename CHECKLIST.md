## 🐛 Common Issues

**"Images don't show after deployment"**
- Make sure image files are uploaded to Vercel along with HTML
- Check file names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)

**"Song doesn't play"**
- Some browsers block autoplay - this is normal
- The confetti still works without sound!

**"Animation is choppy"**
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Close other tabs to free up memory
