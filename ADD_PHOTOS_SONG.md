# 📸 How to Add Your Photos and Song

## 🖼️ Adding Photos

Since Google Photos links need to be downloaded manually, here's the easiest way:

### **Option 1: Download via Browser (EASIEST)**

1. **Open each Google Photos link in your browser:**
   - Photo 1: https://photos.app.goo.gl/TjsJD5A8Hwyyau3m8
   - Photo 2: https://photos.app.goo.gl/bpUKQGn6KHkdbVd27
   - Photo 3: https://photos.app.goo.gl/FZaFD2jP2rZ8XioR7
   - Photo 4: https://photos.app.goo.gl/5fC3FeKBM9ALvk157
   - Photo 5: https://photos.app.goo.gl/5fC3FeKBM9ALvk157 (same as photo 4)
   - Photo 6: https://i.postimg.cc/3JCYJfW1/Screenshot-2026-02-14-074838.png

2. **For each photo:**
   - Click the **download button** (usually top-right)
   - Or **right-click** the image → **Save image as...**

3. **Rename and save each photo** to `d:\Ramyani_birth\` folder:
   ```
   Photo 1 → Save as: placeholder1.jpg
   Photo 2 → Save as: placeholder2.jpg
   Photo 3 → Save as: placeholder3.jpg
   Photo 4 → Save as: placeholder4.jpg
   Photo 5 → Save as: placeholder5.jpg
   Photo 6 → Save as: placeholder-celebration.jpg
   ```

### **Important Notes:**
- ✅ File names must be **exactly** as shown above
- ✅ Save them **directly** in `d:\Ramyani_birth\` folder
- ✅ File extension can be `.jpg` or `.png` (both work)
- ✅ Photo 5 uses the same link as Photo 4 - you can copy the file or download it again
